Following the inaugural [JAMstack_conf in San Francisco](https://2018.jamstackconf.com/) in 2018, and recent editions in both New York and London, we're bringing the conference back to San Francisco where we'll have talks about how to design, develop, and deploy fast, modern web projects that run without web servers.
